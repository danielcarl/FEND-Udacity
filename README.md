Project Plan
------------
APIs: Google Maps, Trulia, Wikipedia

* Map displaying Bouldin neighborhood, Austin, TX
* Hard-coded location list which filters based upon entries in search bar
* Hovering over locations shows location details from Wikipedia, if available

Ideas for future improvement
----------------------------
* Set the default zoom level to be the same (this will allow for 'even' comparisons in phase 3 and 4)
* Points of interest should have a category for comparisons (i.e. 'Neighborhood A has x more coffee shops than Neighborhood B')
* Two maps on different tabs, with a third tab showing comparisons (population, points of interest, crime rates?)
* Allow user to select a city, then use Trulia API to list neighborhoods; user selects neighborhood to be used in comparisons above
